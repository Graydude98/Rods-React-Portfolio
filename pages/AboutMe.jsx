        <p> Hey, what's crackin. My name's Rodney Christopher, I also answer to Roderick. 
          I've always dreamed of bringing some pretty wild imaginations in my head to life that are adventure and action related.
          Also I've gained the desire to try new things and this profession would give me a new sense of fulfilment and a new perspective and so far it has.
          I've also imagined that I would make my own flash videos (of fictional video games and anime when I'm bored.) Either way, I'm glad I started this journey
          and whoever see this, hope you like what you see.  
            <p>If you need to hit my line, there's a couple of link of my social media. </p>
